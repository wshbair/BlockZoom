### information:
```
NODE: Geth/v1.9.23-stable-8c2f2715/linux-amd64/go1.15 on http://localhost:8084
      consensus=ethash chain_name=??? chain_id=15 network_id=3576
SEND: 15000 transactions in blocks 1318-1380 with 10 empty blocks following.
      A sample of transactions looked as if they: succeeded.
TPS:  The stopclock watcher measured a final TPS of 161.2 since contract deploy,
      and in between saw values as high as 178.9 TPS.
DIAG: The whole experiment was prefixed 'iphone'.
      The diagrams were saved into 'img/iphone-20201026-0118_blks1318-1380.png'.
      Looking only at the experiment block-timestamps, the overall TPS was ~167.4.
