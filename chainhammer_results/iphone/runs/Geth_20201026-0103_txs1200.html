<h2>(testing_chainhammer) Geth v1.9.23 with 1200 txs: 139.7 TPS</h2>

<h3>information:</h3>
<PRE>NODE: Geth/v1.9.23-stable-8c2f2715/linux-amd64/go1.15 on http://localhost:8084
      consensus=ethash chain_name=??? chain_id=15 network_id=3576
SEND: 1200 transactions in blocks 575-582 with 10 empty blocks following.
      A sample of transactions looked as if they: succeeded.
TPS:  The stopclock watcher measured a final TPS of 132.8 since contract deploy,
      and in between saw values as high as 138.2 TPS.
DIAG: The whole experiment was prefixed 'testing_chainhammer'.
      The diagrams were saved into 'img/testing_chainhammer-20201026-0103_blks575-582.png'.
      Looking only at the experiment block-timestamps, the overall TPS was ~139.7.
