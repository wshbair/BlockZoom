<h2>(nokia) Geth v1.9.23 with 1500 txs: 199.6 TPS</h2>

<h3>information:</h3>
<PRE>NODE: Geth/v1.9.23-stable-8c2f2715/linux-amd64/go1.15 on http://localhost:8084
      consensus=ethash chain_name=??? chain_id=15 network_id=3576
SEND: 1500 transactions in blocks 1163-1170 with 10 empty blocks following.
      A sample of transactions looked as if they: succeeded.
TPS:  The stopclock watcher measured a final TPS of 199.1 since contract deploy,
      and in between saw values as high as 206.5 TPS.
DIAG: The whole experiment was prefixed 'nokia'.
      The diagrams were saved into 'img/nokia-20201026-0115_blks1163-1170.png'.
      Looking only at the experiment block-timestamps, the overall TPS was ~199.6.
