N.B.: Going to be redone, when repeated in the cloud (all experiments here were on a local desktop). For that we'd need this solved: [BC#51](https://github.com/blk-io/crux/issues/51) to be able to run in docker (not vagrant virtualbox).

## general infos 


about quorum

* there are (at least) two Quorum variants now:
  * (orig) by EEA/jpmc https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum 
  * (fork) by ConsenSys https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum
* integrated whole networks:
  * 7nodes `constellation` (vagrant virtualbox) https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum-examples
  * 7nodes `crux` (vagrant virtualbox) https://github.com/blk-io/quorum-examples
  * 4 nodes `crux` (docker) https://github.com/blk-io/crux/tree/master/docker/quorum-crux

about this benchmarking

* raft consensus: this document here
* Istanbul BFT consensus: [quorum-IBFT.md](quorum-IBFT.md)

## initialize 7nodes

edit `v.memory = 2048` into `v.memory = 4096` (see [#85](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum-examples/issues/85)):
```
git clone https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum-examples
cd quorum-examples
nano Vagrantfile
```

```
vagrant up
vagrant status
vagrant ssh
```

```
cd quorum-examples/7nodes
./raft-init.sh
./raft-start.sh
sleep 3
ps aux | grep geth

./runscript.sh script1.js
```
if that says sth like

> Contract transaction send: TransactionHash: 0x00594... waiting to be mined...  
> true

then we now have a block 1 transaction 0 which contains a simple set()/get() smart contract, which we will later fire our transactions at.

see [send.py](../hammer/send.py) --> ` initialize(contractTx_blockNumber=1, contractTx_transactionIndex=0)`

## virtualenv 
for py3 dependencies, mostly ethereum 
```
virtualenv -p python3 py3eth
source env/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip==9.0.3
pip3 install --upgrade py-solc==2.1.0 web3==4.3.0 web3[tester]==4.3.0 rlp==0.6.0 eth-testrpc==1.3.4 requests 
```
see [hints from the Web3.py team](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.py/issues/808#issuecomment-386014138)

## start listener

```
python tps.py
```

## start hammering

### blocking
```
python send.py
```

Initially could see only 12-15 tps; eventually (raft, non-private contract) about 100 TPS average.

### multithreaded 1

you must kill (`CTRL-C`), and restart the listener, then:

```
python send.py threaded1
```
 
The best rate that I have seen was 146 TPS, as average over 1000 transactions.


### multithreaded 2
not a new thread per each of the `N` transaction but a queue with `M` multithreaded workers. 

```
python send.py threaded2 23
```

see [log.md](log.md) for details, and the sweet spot `M=23`

Best average rate: 177 TPS.

### chainreader
* Quorum, raft consensus
* submitted 1000 transactions, multi-threaded with 23 workers
* the image shows the third such experiment on a newly started [quorum-examples/7nodes](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum-examples/tree/master/examples/7nodes) network
* average TPS around 160 TPS, about 20 blocks per second

## faster

See [log.md](log.md) for what I have tried to get this faster.

### Much later repeat

With newest chainhammer code (version [v24](https://github.com/drandreaskrueger/chainhammer/commit/69407bab63ca56fb62bae736c9cf3e6a7c32c6c0)), 
and with 10 multithreading workers, 
and with RPC calls instead of web3.contract calls, 
and with 7nodes in the standard constellation version of the [quorum-examples-->raft](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum-examples),
we are seeing around ~200 TPS now for raft consensus:

### suggestions please
how can I speed this up?

* see [jpmsam suggestions April 18th](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum/issues/346#issuecomment-382523147)
  * run on host machine, not in vagrant VB - implemented, but [crashes](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum/issues/352)
  * direct RPC communication not via web3 - implemented, gives a slight improvement
  * [eth_sendTransactionAsync](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q="eth_sendTransactionAsync") - not implemented yet, might also not be generally applicable in all situations, right?
* replace `constellation` by [Crux](https://github.com/blk-io/crux) ???


## IBFT = Istanbul BFT
All of the above was done with the "Raft Consensus Algorithm".

**Next I would be switching to *"Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerant" (IBFT)* ** Consensus Algorithm.

Differences to the raft chainhammer code (already solved, to benchmark the [Tobalaba](tobalaba.md) EnergyWebClient):

* the smart contract deployment transaction cannot reliably be found in block 0; instead 
  * we reimplemented `script1.js` into a real programming language, which is allowed to write to file --> `deploy.py`
* 'raft' is producing no empty blocks, so the trigger for ["waiting for something to happen"](https://github.com/drandreaskrueger/chainhammer/blob/ca97cf5de66df03b26e3bf28f2a0ca9a621cc781/tps.py#L108-110) needed be a different one than blocks moving forwards; it is now just waiting for that `contract-address.json` file to be updated.

--> benchmarking IBFT should be simple, and straightforward. Let's see:

in 7 nodes quorum-examples:
```
cd quorum-examples/7nodes/
./istanbul-init.sh 
./istanbul-start.sh 
tail -f qdata/logs/1.log 
```

in chainhammer:
`config.py`: 
```
RPCaddress, RPCaddress2 = 'http://localhost:22000', 'http://localhost:22001'
RAFT=False
```
terminal 1:
```
source env/bin/activate
./tps.py
```
terminal 2:
```
source env/bin/activate
./deploy.py notest; ./send.py threaded2 23
```

Does not work yet, as contract deployment seems to be slightly different in "Quorum" (Geth) than in "Energy Web" (Parity).

## alternative: dockerized quorum nodes
Always used the 7nodes example as described above, but there is also https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-docker-Nnodes = Run a bunch of Quorum nodes, each in a separate Docker container. Untested.
