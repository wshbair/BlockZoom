# [chainhammer](../README.md): Tobalaba
Purpose: Extending the quorum benchmarking to other Ethereum-type chains. 

Here: *Toabalaba chain of the EnergyWebFoundation*, a fork of parity.

## shortcuts:
directly jump to 

* script outputs --> [#results](#results)
* **benchmarking result --> [#tps](#tps)**
* 5 TPS ? --> [#conclusion](#conclusion)

## useful sites for Tobalaba:

* [netstats](http://netstats.energyweb.org/) about the authority nodes
* block explorer e.g. --> [pending transactions](https://tobalaba.etherscan.com/txsPending)
* [faucet](https://energyweb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EWF/pages/126517249) to get Tobalaba-ETH 
* EWF [website](https://energyweb.org/blockchain/) 

## quickstart

* sync your energyweb client, with some special switches: `./tobalaba-node-start.sh`
* put Tobalaba-Ether onto the first address of that node; and its passphrase into `account-passphrase.txt`
* clone this repo (and checkout e.g. commit cd844ea7 because that definitely contains [the correct](#config) `config.py`)
* install the [virtualenv & dependencies](../README.md#dependencies) - each of the following terminals needs to start that venv first, with `source env/bin/activate`
* first terminal:   `./tps.py`
* second terminal: `./deploy.py notest && ./send.py threaded2 23`

## preparations 

### start node
    
#### initial problems:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
  File "...python3.5/site-packages/web3/contract.py", line 1311, in transact_with_contract_function
    txn_hash = web3.eth.sendTransaction(transact_transaction)
...
ValueError: {'message': 'There are too many transactions in the queue. 
                         Your transaction was dropped due to limit. Try increasing the fee.', 'code': -32010}
```

solved by enlarging the *transaction queue*, with additional startup parameters

    --tx-queue-mem-limit=0
    --tx-queue-per-sender=2000 
    --tx-queue-gas=off 

I now start the node with these parameters

    ./target/release/parity --chain tobalaba --pruning=archive --geth --rpcapi "web3,eth,personal,net,parity" \
                            --db-compaction=ssd --cache-size=2048 --no-persistent-txqueue \
                            --tx-queue-mem-limit=0 --tx-queue-per-sender=10001 --tx-queue-gas=off \
                            --reserved-peers <PATH>/tobalaba-peers.txt

(See [tobalaba-node-start.sh](../networks/tobalaba-node-start.sh) - in it, just change your path)


Then it accepted 10000 transactions.
    
### account, password

By default, the [deploy.py](../hammer/deploy.py) uses the first address `web3.eth.accounts[0]`.    

Put your `unlockAccount` passphrase into the file `account-passphrase.txt` (the passphrase must not have whitespaces at the beginning or end).  

### make sure not overflooded already

see Tobalaba pending transactions: https://tobalaba.etherscan.com/txsPending

If there are many already, then just wait a while.

### virtualenv
In each terminal start the virtualenv (before the following python scripts):

    source env/bin/activate

See [quorum.md#virtualenv](quorum.md#virtualenv) for which dependencies to install.

## benchmark

### config
in [config.py](../hammer/config.py) manually set:
```
RPCaddress, RPCaddress2 = 'http://localhost:8545', 'http://localhost:8545'
RAFT=False
```

### start listener

    ./tps.py

It will start counting as soon as it sees a new `contract-address.json` file generated by:

### deploy, start sending
Deploys new contract (saves contract address to `contract-address.json`), and then immediately starts sending:

    ./deploy.py notest; ./send.py threaded2 23

or single-threaded:

    ./deploy.py notest; ./send.py 

after each experiment, **restart the listener** `tps.py`, and redeploy the contract.


# results

## 1000 transactions - but bad connectivity
* multi-threaded with 23 workers threads
* submitted via web3 `Web3(HTTPProvider('http://localhost:8545'))` = RPC --> perhaps [IPC]() would be faster? - was github.com/energywebfoundation/energyweb-client/issues/26 but they killed that repo, sadly 
* with background of only 1-2 unrelated transactions per block
* to local (non-authority) node
  * which had very few peers, often 0/25 - see issue [#24]() - was github.com/energywebfoundation/energyweb-client/issues/24 but they killed that repo, sadly 

--> **3 - 5 TPS on average**:

## 20,000 transactions, better connectivity

See issue [EWC#24]() (was github.com/energywebfoundation/energyweb-client/issues/24 but they killed that repo, sadly) = previously (above), my client often had only 1/25 peers and sometimes even 0/25 peers. That had decreased the transaction speed when hammering, as we found out when hardcoding 5 nodes with their enodes, see [tobalaba-peers.txt](../networks/tobalaba-peers.txt) and [tobalaba-node-start.sh](../networks/tobalaba-node-start.sh). 

Why don't more nodes get added automatically? Was the [peer discovery broken]() (was github.com/energywebfoundation/energyweb-client/issues/24 but they killed that repo, sadly ) in this old parity fork? Even with the hardcoded nodes now, the highest number of peers I ever see is 4/25 (but there are e.g. 12 authority nodes).

Nevertheless, now with more peers, the TPS benchmarking gets to higher results! -->

### better connectivity results: > 150 TPS

--> chainreader / [blocksDB_analyze_tobalaba-better.ipynb](../reader/outdated/README.md)

![../reader/img/tobalaba_tps-bt-bs-gas_blks5173630-5173671.png](../reader/img/tobalaba_tps-bt-bs-gas_blks5173630-5173671.png)


## Conclusion

* **3 - 5 TPS** on average during 1000 transactions if the local client is badly connected
* **more than 150 TPS** if the local client has 2-3 peers

Hello energywebfoundation: Any additional ideas how to make this faster? Please you yourself try these benchmarking scripts. 

Thanks.

## solution for ( * )

### ewfclient == fork of parity 1.8.0 (?)

get commit hashes of both repos, and compare them:
```
git clone https://github.com/paritytech/parity.git paritytech_parity
cd paritytech_parity/
git log --oneline > ../commit_hashes_paritytech.txt
cd ../energywebfoundation_energyweb-client/
git log --oneline > ../commit_hashes_ewf.txt

# all commits since the fork, and of that - only the first differing one:
diff commit_hashes_ewf.txt commit_hashes_paritytech.txt  | grep \< | tail -n 1
```
result:
```

That first commit was done Sep 7, 2017 --> github.com/energywebfoundation/energyweb-client/commit/976cf4182 (sadly, they removed that repo not)

The parent of that commit was Aug 31, 2017   
github.com/energywebfoundation/energyweb-client/commit/47f7366a5c6a34dd4a587916296e0869475c15de  
= https://github.com/paritytech/parity/commit/47f7366a5c6a34dd4a587916296e0869475c15de

now, which parity version number was that?

```
cd paritytech_parity
git reset --hard  47f7366a5c6a34dd4a587916296e0869475c15de
grep Cargo.toml -e 'version'
```
results in:

```
version = "1.8.0"
clippy = { version = "0.0.103", optional = true}
rustc_version = "0.2"
```

so ... I guess they have forked from **parity version 1.8.0**.
