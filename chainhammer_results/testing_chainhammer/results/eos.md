and [post 2](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/17447#issuecomment-415705182).

>  improve existing consensus algorithm for public use  
> implement modified version of DPOS under ethereum environment

## on pause

1. They don't have a dockerized/virtualbox-vagrant setup yet, so I [suggested that in an issue]() - was github.com/eosclassic/eosclassic/issues/19 but they killed that repo, sadly.  
1. As we [already have results for the  PoA algorithm Clique](geth.md), I am not going to benchmark EOS now  
  * but their second post reads as if they are also *planning to improve Clique* - then it might be worthwhile.

## you
Feel free to run chainhammer benchmarks yourself now - see [quickstart](README.md#quickstart).

## issues
* [ECTW#1]() please switch ON github issues in any of your repos - was github.com/eosclassicteam/whitepaper/issues/1 but they sadly killed that repo
* [ECEC#19]() wanted: tool for several nodes setup - github.com/eosclassic/eosclassic/issues/19 but they sadly killed that repo
